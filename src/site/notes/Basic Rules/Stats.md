Statistics (Stats) are numbers that describe a character's abilities.
There are 6 Stats:
- Might (MIT)
- Reflex (REF)
- Soul (SOUL)
- Intelligence (INT)
- Willpower (WILL)
- Empathy (EMP)

Each Stat starts with a number of points determined during [[Basic Rules/Character Creation\|Character Creation]], and more can be added upon [[Leveling Up\|Leveling Up]].
The primary purpose of Stats is to determine the outcome of [[Basic Rules/Checks\|Checks]], either directly or indirectly through [[Basic Rules/Skills\|Skills]].

## Primary Stats
Primary Stats are Stats in which your character is particularly skilled. You choose these during [[Basic Rules/Character Creation\|Character Creation]]. You use a different table when rolling to determine your starting points in Primary Stats than regular Stats.
