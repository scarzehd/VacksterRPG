This document outlines the creation of a character in the Vackster RPG system.

## Step 1: Determine Primary Stats
The first step is to determine your character's [[Basic Rules/Stats#Primary Stats\|Primary Stats]]. Every Player Character may choose two Stats as Primary Stats.

## Step 2: Roll Stats
Roll 2d10 and take note of the higher roll. Repeat this until you have 6 numbers. Next, assign each number to one Stat. If the stat is a Primary Stat, refer to the [[Basic Rules/Stats#Primary Stat Table\|Primary Stat Table]] to determine the score in that Stat. Otherwise, use the [[Basic Rules/Stats#Regular Stat Table\|Regular Stat Table]].

## Step 3: Reroll if necessary
Add up the scores in all of your Stats. If the total is less than 16, discard your Stats and return to Step 2.

## Step 4: Distribute Skill Points #WIP 

## Example: S. C. Arzehd
Let's say there's a character named S. C. Arzehd. First, Arzehd's player chooses WILL and INT as his Primary Stats. Next, Arzehd's player rolls 2d10 six times. After discarding the lower roll in each pair, he is left with the following numbers: 7, 10, 8, 4, 3, and 9. Arzehd's player distributes these numbers as shown:

Stat | Number Rolled | Corresponding Stat Score
:---:|:-------------:|:-----------------------:
 MIT | 4 | 2
 REF | 7 | 3
 VIT | 8 | 4
 INT | 10 | 6
 WILL | 9 | 5
 EMP | 3 | 1
