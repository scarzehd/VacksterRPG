This document outlines the creation of a character in the Vackster RPG system.

## Step 1: Determine Primary Stats
The first step is to determine your character's [[Basic Rules/Stats#Primary Stats\|Primary Stats]]. Every Player Character may choose two Stats as Primary Stats.

## Step 2: Roll Stats
For each Stat, roll 2d10 and discard the lower roll. If the stat is a Primary Stat, refer to the [[Basic Rules/Stats#Primary Stat Table\|Primary Stat Table]] to determine the score in that Stat. Otherwise, use the [[Basic Rules/Stats#Regular Stat Table\|Regular Stat Table]].

## Step 3: Reroll if necessary
Add up the scores in all of your Stats. If the total is less than 12, discard your Stats and return to Step 2.

## Step 4: Distribute Skill Points #WIP
