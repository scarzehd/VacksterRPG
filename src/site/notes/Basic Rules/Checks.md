A Check is a way to test a character's ability when the outcome of an action is uncertain. When you make a Check, the GM will specify a a [[Basic Rules/Skills\|Skill]]. Roll a d10 and add the value of the Skill as well as the value of its associated [[Basic Rules/Stats\|Stat]]. Finally, apply any bonuses or penalties you may have. The GM will compare the total with a target number; if the Check total is equal to or greater than this target number, the Check succeeds. Otherwise, the Check fails.

## Contests
Contests are a special kind of Check where, instead of comparing the result to a target number, the Check is compared to another Check.

> [!Note]
> The character that initiates the Contest is known as the Attacker, and the character that is resisting the Contest is known as the Defender.
