Whereas [[Basic Rules/Stats\|Stats]] are a measure of a character's innate abilities, Skills measure a character's training. Each Skill is tied to a Stat. This Stat is added to the points in the Skill to when making [[Basic Rules/Checks\|Checks]].
Here is a list of all Skills and the Stat that they are tied to:

Skill | Stat | Short Description
-- | -- | --
Recall | INT | Used to recall information a character might reasonably know
Stunts | DEX | Used to perform some kind of athletic or acrobatic stunt
Socialize | EMP | Used to interact with other sentient beings
Channel | See [[Magic/Magic#Channel Checks\|Magic#Channel Checks]] | Used to determine the effectiveness of [[Magic/Magic\|Magic]]
