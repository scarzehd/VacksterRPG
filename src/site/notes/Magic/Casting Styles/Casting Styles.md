Casting Styles are archetypes used in the VacksterRPG system to describe the general mechanics of a character's [[Magic/Magic\|Magic]]. Several will be provided here, but if none of them fit your character, it is recommended that you work with your GM to create your own.

Each Casting Style will tell you which [[Basic Rules/Stats\|Stat]] it uses for its [[Magic/Magic#Channel Checks\|Channel Checks]] as well as the special mechanic(s) that are specific to it.
