Magic is the ability for a character to make changes on the world around them. In characters that have [[Soul\|Souls]], these changes can be large and magnificent or small and unnoticeable.
Regardless of how a character chooses to use their Magic, it can typically be described by an archetype called a [[Magic/Casting Styles/Casting Styles\|Casting Style]]. Your Casting Style determines what Stat you use for your Channel Checks.

## Channel Checks
Channel is a special [[Basic Rules/Skills\|Skill]] that can only be permanently increased when a character [[Leveling Up\|Levels Up]]. The [[Basic Rules/Stats\|Stat]] that it is tied to is dependent on your [[Magic/Casting Styles/Casting Styles\|Casting Style]].
